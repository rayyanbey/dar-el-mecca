Footwear must be in the form of sandals for both women and men."

Sun cream is particularly handy, especially if you have no hair as it is not permissible for men to cover their head or face whilst in ihram. Vaseline is also particularly valuable for both women and men to protect against painful rashes that may occur as a result of constant walking. All of these are readily available in Saudi Arabia."

The three Jamarat indicate the three places where Iblis tried to dissuade Ibrahim (AS) from obeying the command of Allah. However, the pillars do not contain Iblis, as many people are wrongly led to believe.",
            "How To Perform The Rami (The Stoning Of The Devil) On the 10th, 11th, and 12th day of Dhul Hijjah, you will perform Rami (the stoning of the devil). The size of the pebbles should be similar to the size of date stones or seeds. You will need a total of 49 pebbles.",

UK coin bags are a good size and convenient to carry. Use the four pouches to group pebbles according to the breakdown above.",

            "Once you reach the Jamarat, you will head to Jamarat al-Aqaba, which is the largest pillar, and here you will throw the first seven pebbles at the concrete pillar. You will only pelt this one pillar on the first day.",
